== General

=== About this document

This document is a part of a specification series. Each part specifies the contents of a Submodel template for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The AAS is described in link:#bib1[[1\]], link:#bib2[[2\]], link:#bib3[[3\]] and link:#bib6[[6\]]. First exemplary Submodel contents were described in link:#bib4[[4\]], while the actual format of this document was derived by the "Administration Shell in Practice" link:#bib5[[5\]]. The format aims to be very concise, giving only minimal necessary information for applying a Submodel template, while leaving deeper descriptions and specification of concepts, structures and mapping to the respective documents link:#bib1[[1\]] to link:#bib6[[6\]].

The target group of the specification are developers and editors of technical documentation and manufacturer information, which are describing assets in smart manufacturing by means of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and therefore need to create a Submodel instance with a hierarchy of SubmodelElements. This document especially details on the question, which SubmodelElements with which semantic identification shall be used for this purpose.

=== Scope of the Submodel

This Submodel template aims to provide asset nameplate information to the respective Asset Administration Shells in an interoperable manner. Central element is the provision of properties link:#bib7[[7\]], ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common Data Dictionary). While in the current version an IRI is provided for a small quantity of the specified properties as their semantic identifier, a complete harmonization of all properties is planned for the subsequent version 2.1. The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in such manner that information about assets and their nameplate can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It targets equipment for process industry and factory automation by defining standardized meta data.

The intended use case is the provision of a standardized property structure within a digital nameplate, which enables the interoperability of digital nameplates from different manufacturers.

This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on existing norms, directives and standards so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved.

Beside standardized Submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling partial aspects within Submodels. The standardized SMCs include address and asset product marking.

=== Relevant standards for the Submodel template

The current version of the Submodel template is considered to meet the minimum requirement for nameplate information, hence it concentrates on the requirements specified by EU directives according to the Blue Guide published in the Official Journal of the EU-Commission. Furthermore, the current version provides a concept for modelling nameplate information required in the field of explosion protection according to the Directive 2014/34/EU.

The EU directive 2006/42/EC aims to standardize the market entry requirements for machines in the European economic area and further related countries. In regard to nameplate the EU directive establishes the minimum requirements on information a nameplate should provide which state as follows:

* the business name and full address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, his authorised representative,
* designation of the machinery,
* the CE Marking,
* designation of series or type,
* serial number, if any,
* the year of construction, that is the year in which the manufacturing process is completed.

With regard to explosion-protected equipment, various additional information is required for the respective device to be contained in the nameplate link:#bib8[[8\]]. The additional information set also strongly depends on the country, e.g.

* Directive 2014/34/EU: specific mark of explosion protection, Equipment Group, Category, Gas or Dust areas etc.
* IEC Ex: Type of Protection, Equipment Protection Level, certificate number, etc.
* North America: Class, Division, Groups, Type of Protection, etc.

According to link:#bib3[[3\]], interoperable properties might be defined by standards, consortium specifcations or manufacturer specifications. Useful standards providing sources of concepts are:

.List of examplary standards defining interoperable properties

* IEC CDD, see: https://cdd.iec.ch/cdd/iec61987/iec61987.nsf and https://cdd.iec.ch/cdd/iec62683/cdddev.nsf

In this document, properties are aimed to be described by ECLASS.

Further relevant basic requirements for nameplates are described in link:#bib8[[8\]] and link:#bib9[[9\]].

Requirements specified by further regulations and directives will be taken into account in subsequent versions.

== Information set for Submodel “Nameplate”

The Submodel template was motivated by the prior ZVEI project “Digital Nameplate”. While defining Submodels the following three aspects must be considered as suggested in link:#bib5[[5\]]:

*Use and economic relevance*

A nameplate contains identifying, descriptive and indicating information about an asset. Given the variety of requirements from national and global institutions, conventional nameplate have reached their limits of presenting mandatory content. Especially for industrial equipment in explosion hazardous areas the amount of information required on the markings has increased even more. The Submodel “Nameplate” helps to standardize the information structure for modelling a nameplate in compliance with EU Machine Directive 2006/42/EC. As a result, a breakthrough of restrictions due to limited labeling field can be achieved. At the same time the availability of asset information is widened from local to global level enabling further partners along the value chain to have access to nameplate information. The machine readability can be realized without ambiguity with the help of semantic information.

*Possible functions and interactions*

The Submodel “Nameplate” provides information from a nameplate. Customers or potential customers can use this Submodel to acquire identifying, classifying information about an asset, such as the manufacturer name, model type or serial number and the provided product markings. Customers can also use this Submodel to verify the asset with their order. Beside the customers public authorities and inter-trade organizations may also share interest in this Submodel in order to examine the information integrity stipulated for a nameplate. Manufacturers use this Submodel to fulfill the legal commitment on the one hand, on the other hand this Submodel helps them to identify the right asset in case maintenance services or spare parts are needed.

By using the SMC “Marking” and its child element SMC “ExplosionSafety” mandatory nameplate content related to explosion protection can be modelled sufficiently. The modelling method was concepted in such manner that a wide range of national and international regulations and standards regarding explosion protection were taken into account.

In order to take regulations for nameplate from further standards or directives into account additional properties can be modelled with SMC “AssetSpecificProperties” and its child element SMC “GuidelineSpecificProperties” while reference to the additional standard document should be stored in the property “GuidelineForConformityDeclaration”. A separate SMC “GuidelineSpecificProperties” needs to be created for each additional standard and all SMC “GuidelineSpecificProperties” should be placed under the parent node “AssetSpecificProperties”.

*Property specification*

=== Mandatory properties of the SMC “ContactInformation” for physical address

In order to provide information about a physical address, the SMC “ContactInformation” defined by link:#bib11[[11\]] is to be re-used in the context of digital nameplate.

Due to the fact that the SMC “ContactInformation” has been concepted to provide interoperable contact information thus all properties within the SMC “ContactInformation” are defined as optional, this chapter defines properties that are mandatorily required to ensure the provision of physical address.

Figure 3 shows the UML-diagram defining the relevant properties which need to be set mandatory.

Table 3 describes the details of the SMC structure combined with examples.

Regarding the property “MarkingName” the preferable solution is to provide a valueId in IRDI originating from ECLASS enumeration value list, e.g. "CE” (IRDI: 0173-1#07-DAA603#004). In case none of the existing ECLASS enumeration values matches, filling plain string text into the “value” field of the property “MarkingName” can be accepted alternatively. It needs to be pointed out that ECLASS also provides marking definitions in terms of boolean property, e.g. “CE- qualification present” (IRDI: 0173-1#02-BAF053#008). In this case users should instead use a matching ECLASS enumeration value or, if not provided as enumeration, fill in plain string text.

The following example illustrates how to model product marking in an AAS. On the left side there is a sample nameplate which contains two markings to be modelled: the CE marking and the WEEE marking with a crossed-out wheeled bin. Next to the nameplate a table lists all properties and their attributes.

Beside the mentioned EU Machine Directive 2006/42/EC which this Submodel template is compliant with, there might be further information required by further stipulations and regulations depending on different asset. The SMC “AssetSpecificProperties” and its child SMC “GuidelineSpecificProperties” are therefore used to cover additional mandatory nameplate information while referencing the related stipulation or regulation.

In the following example a pressure equipment is addressed. Due to EU Directive 2014/68/EU the essential maximum/minimum allowable limits shall be provided for all pressure equipment. The example in [.mark]####Figure 8 shows a possible modelling of SMC “GuidelineSpecificProperties” in order to specify the minimum and maximum allowable pressure.

== Explanations on used table formats

=== General

The used tables in this document try to outline information as concise as possible. They do not convey all information on Submodels and SubmodelElements. For this purpose, the definitive definitions are given by a separate file in form of an AASX file of the Submodel template and its elements.

=== Tables on Submodels and SubmodelElements

For clarity and brevity, a set of rules is used for the tables for describing Submodels and SubmodelElements.

* The tables follow in principle the same conventions as in link:#bib5[[5\]].
* The table heads abbreviate 'cardinality' with 'card'.
* The tables often place two informations in different rows of the same table cell. In this case, the first information is marked out by sharp brackets [] form the second information. A special case are the semanticIds, which are marked out by the format: (type)(local)[idType]value.
* The types of SubmodelElements are abbreviated:

[width=100%, options="autowidth,header"]
|===
|SME type |SubmodelElement type
|Property |Property
|MLP |MultiLanguageProperty
|Range |Range
|File |File
|Blob |Blob
|Ref |ReferenceElement
|Rel |RelationshipElement
|SMC |SubmodelElementCollection
|===

* If an idShort ends with '\{00}', this indicates a suffix of the respective length (here: 2) of decimal digits, in order to make the idShort unique. A different idShort might be choosen, as long as it is unique in the parent’s context.
* The Keys of semanticId in the main section feature only idType and value, such as: [IRI]https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/DocumentId/Id. The attributes "type" and "local" (typically "ConceptDescription" and "(local)" or "GlobalReference" and (no-local)") need to be set accordingly; see link:#bib6[[6\]].
* If a table does not contain a column with "parent" heading, all represented attributes share the same parent. This parent is denoted in the head of the table.
* Multi-language strings are represented by the text value, followed by '@'-character and the ISO 639 language code: example@EN.
* The [valueType] is only given for Properties.
